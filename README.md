My friend and I did this project in the Design and Development of information systems course in our third semester.

This project is about an Airline application for managers and customers.
- Managers can manage everything about the flights, like airplanes, pilots, airports, dates, etc.
  1) Main Manager: add flight, get a report for big flights, report about flight group by country, update flight status.
  2) Flights Manager: add flight, get a report for big flights, update flight status.
  3) Employees Manager: assign main and second pilot for chosen flight, assign several air attendants according to plane size.

Every manager can sign in to the account by filling up a default username and password according to his Position.

We used access as a database.
